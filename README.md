# Gallery


## Purpose

I have recently become interested in some cool features that are found in certain apps, such as Apple Music and Samsung Gallery.

I intend to implement those awesome UI interactions from other apps in my own application for learning purposes. Specifically, I am looking to incorporate elements such as intuitive user flows, seamless transitions between screens, and visually appealing design elements. In doing so, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of effective UI design principles and how they can be applied in the context of my own project.

- Application contains three individual modules: music player, photo album, video player.
- Application has two theme: light and dark theme, corresponds to Android systemâ€™s two themes.
- Design compliance Material Design.
- Develop compliance jetpack MVVM architecture development.

Design inspired from Apple Music.

There is some features that I found pretty cool.

There is fluid transition as player view background.

The background will move and changes like fluid.

I couldn't figure out how it works, so I found a project that implements this feature in a very easy way.

Project address is: https://github.com/dokar3/amlv.git

This is completed with three layers of gradient rectangle, every layer will rotate in difference speed.
