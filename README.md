# Gallery

I've recently become interested in some cool features found in certain apps, such as Apple Music and Samsung Gallery.

Apple Music has unique user experience, every page can be described as elegant. These is some elements I feel very cool and I intend to implement.

## Player layer UX

This is a pretty cool transition for navigate to player view from music list, and there is no extra elements on particular page, user can press player layer, and it will smoothly swipe up to whole page and display player view.

## Main player page

### Fluid background

Clean page shows user to control player state. Background of page is blur layer of music album cover primary color, and it’s/ fluid animation, this is a quite unique UI in apps. I’ve searched for this and this effect can be implemented by gradient in Android.

### Lyrics

In music app lyrics can play important role, lyrics will slide along with music, in Apple Music lyrics smoothly slide and scale up when indexed, user’s eye attention will appeal to this line.
